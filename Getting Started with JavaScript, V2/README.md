**Intro & Overview**
  * 3 Pillars of JS
    * Types/Coercion
    * Scope/Closures
    * this/Prototypes
    * Kyle's book series dives really deep into each topic

**Programming Primer:**
    * No distinction between numbers and numbers with decimal places (integer/float)
    * `null` & `undefined` - empty values
    * `+` operator is an overloaded operator, that way it can be used for strings (concat) and numbers (arithmetic)
    * array is a subtype of object
      * `typeof [1,2,3] //object`
    * Variable - representation of a location in memory
    * `console` is a variable, a built in operator
    * `()` is an overloaded operator
      * used in grouping `(5 * 6)` - groups the operation
      * `()` after a function is a call operator
